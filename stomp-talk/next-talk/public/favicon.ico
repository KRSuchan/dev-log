The favicon.ico file is a binary file that typically contains an image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon.ico file separately. You can use an online favicon generator or design your own icon and save it as favicon.ico.

Please ensure that the favicon.ico file is placed in the /my-nextjs-app/my-nextjs-app/public/ directory as specified in your project structure.
